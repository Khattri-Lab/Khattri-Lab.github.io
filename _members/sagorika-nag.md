Hey, I am Sagorika Nag, a 5th-year IDD student interested in computational biology and bioinformatics and am working on the identification of molecular targets for the treatment of HNSCC. We particularly are interested in genes involved in sialylation that promote immune evasion. I am also a DAAD-WISEâ€™23 scholar and will be working on deep learning based binding affinity prediction between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and epitopes, at TU Munich. Outside of my academics, I like listening to music and reading books!
