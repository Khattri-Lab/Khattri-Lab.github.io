Hi, I'm Shloka Negi, President Gold Medalist IIT-BHU, Batch 2022. I'm currently a PhD student at University of California, Santa Cruz in Biomolecular Engineering and Bioinformatics. I work in Dr. Karen Miga's lab (https://migalab.com/) and am co-advised by Dr. Benedict Paten (https://cglgenomics.ucsc.edu/). I am part of the Computational Genomics Lab (CGL) at UCSC-Genomics Institute. Currently, I am involved in the Rare-Disease project, housed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, which aims to identify genetic causes of patients suspected with rare and undiagnosed conditions using long-read nanopore sequencing. Long reads have given us access to previously unexplored parts of the genome, including centromeres and telomeres which harbour repeat-rich sequences and satellite DNA. The Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium (T2T), a team co-led by Dr. Karen Miga, UCSC and Dr. Adam Phillippy, NIH released the first ever gapless complete assembly of the human genome in March 2022 (https://www.quantamagazine.org/karen-miga-fills-in-the-missing-pieces-of-our-genome-20210908/). As a member of the team now, I am interested in generating centromeric annotations for these assemblies, as well as helping with the HG002-Q100 project to develop the T2T highest quality HG002 diploid genome. This complete benchmark will push genomic technology developers to create better sequencing methods that can call everything in the human genome and not just easy variants.

When I'm not 'sciencing', I am a musician who just grabs her guitar and begins to make music. Besides, I love travelling and cooking.
