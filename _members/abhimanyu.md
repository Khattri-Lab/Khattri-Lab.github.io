Abhimanyu Mandal

My name is Abhimanyu Mandal, and I am in my 5th year of undergraduate studies at the Indian Institute of Technology, BHU (IIT-BHU). 
Specifically, I am interested in applying bioinformatics to understand better the underlying gene regulation mechanisms in various cancers such as Head and Neck Cancer. In addition, I am a MITACS-GRI'23 scholar at the Western University, London, Ontario, Canada. My hobbies include listening to music and playing lawn tennis.
