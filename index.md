# gene analysis 

Welcome to the KHATTRI LAB, a state-of-the-art research facility located at the Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering and Technology at the Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi. Our lab is dedicated to advancing the field of gene expression analysis and bioinformatics through cutting-edge research and innovative techniques.

At the KHATTRI LAB, we strive to understand the complex mechanisms underlying gene expression, and to develop new tools and technologies to study these mechanisms. Our research is focused on integrating data from multiple sources, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, to gain a comprehensive understanding of biological systems.

Led by Dr. Arun Khattri, our team of dedicated researchers and students are passionate about advancing the field of gene expression analysis and bioinformatics, and are committed to making meaningful contributions to scientific knowledge.

We invite you to explore our website to learn more about our research, publications, and team members.
