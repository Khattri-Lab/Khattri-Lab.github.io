# Khattri Lab @ IIT (BHU) Varanasi 

Cancer is a complex disease where multiple factors interplay in the progression of the cancer. My lab utilizes wet lab experiments and computational methods to understand the functional relevance of various genomic aberrations in cancer patients.  The long-term goal of my lab is to develop a better understanding of how genetic aberrations shape the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) to eventually improve the prognosis of oral cancer patients.
