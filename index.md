# synergize AI, machine vision and microscopy 

AI-based microscopy machine vision research is a highly interdisciplinary field requiring good knowledge of machine learning, computer vision, microscopy and the associated biomedical applications. We develop new deep learning and computer vision algorithms driven by real biomedical applications, we also generalize or productionize existing deep learning and computer vision algorithms for high-dimenstional microscopy images, so that more people can access to the high-end algorithms in their biomedical research. To do this, we are building a diverse group with different expertise and embrace extensive internal and external collaborations.
